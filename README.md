Simple Among Us Map in Elm with Clean Leaves and Swipe Card Tasks

You can run the map to access the tasks directly from the ```index.html``` file.
Alternatively, you can download all the files on your computer and use ```elm reactor``` in the terminal inside the files directory to start a local host and access the files from there.

You can also access the code in the ```Main.elm``` file to make changes.
